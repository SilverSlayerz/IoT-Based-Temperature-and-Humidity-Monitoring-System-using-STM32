# IoT-Based-Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-System-using-STM32

Designed an IoT-enabled embedded system to measure and monitor temperature and humidity in real time using a DHT11 sensor interfaced with the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE board.
Programmed the STM32 in Embedded C using HAL libraries for sensor data acquisition, processing, and LCD display output via I2C communication.
Implemented UART communication between STM32 and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to transmit sensor data to ThingSpeak dashboard for live visualization and analytics.
Integrated a TinyML model on STM32 for on-device temperature and humidity prediction and trend analysis.
